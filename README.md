EEG Signal Classification Project:
This project focuses on using a classification algorithm to differentiate between segments of EEG signals that correspond to eye opening and eye closing. 
The data utilized in this project was obtained from a subject using a 2-electrode EEG system.

Project Overview:
In this project, we performed the following steps:

Preprocessing of EEG signals to ensure data quality and remove artifacts.
Identification and correction of bad channels.
Feature extraction to capture relevant information from the EEG signals.
Model training using machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, and others.
Evaluation of the models' performance in classifying EEG segments into eye open or closed states.
